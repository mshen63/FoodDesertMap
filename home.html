            <h1>WHAT ARE FOOD DESERTS?</h1>
            <h3>Food deserts are regions where people have limited access to nutritious and affordable food.
                According to the USDA, a food desert in an urban area is somewhere where at least 33% of the population
                live
                more than one mile from a grocery story. In rural areas, at least 33% of the population must live more
                than
                10 miles from a grocery store.

                <h3>With the onset of the pandemic, the situation in food deserts all around the country has
                    exacerbated. Cut back grocery store operating hours and limited public transportation have revealed
                    the severity of food deserts. </h3>
            </h3>

            <h1>WHAT IS THE IMPACT?</h1>
            <h3>Food deserts disproportionally affect low income areas with high levels of unemployment and inadequate
                public
                transportation. Areas with these characteristics often have a low number of food detailers offering
                healthy
                options at affordable prices. Residents often have to pay 10-40% more for food items in these areas.
            </h3>
            <h3>Studies show that those who live more than a mile from a supermarket are 25-46% less likely to have a
                healthy diet. Without access to healthy foods, residents of food deserts may be at higher risk of
                diet-related conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</h3>

            <h1>WHAT CAN WE DO?</h1>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    - Incentivize the opening of more supermarkets in target low access locations
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    - Subsidize healthier food options so they are more affordable for low income populations
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    - Support local food exchanges, businesses, and farmers markets in expanding and reaching more rural
                    regions
                </ul>
                <ul>

                    - Invest in educational programs that promote healthy eating
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </ul>
